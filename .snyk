  CWE-295:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          The Improper Certificate Validation does not apply to the
          metrics-agents default configuration. The reason we have this
          vulnerability is we allow the agent to run in an insecure mode (not
          recommended) which is explicitly designed to avoid cert validation.
          This vulnerability does not apply as long as CLOUDABILITY_INSECURE is
          false (default behaivor)
