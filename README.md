# metrics-agent

The metrics-agent collects allocation metrics from a Kubernetes cluster system and sends the metrics to cloudability to help you gain visibility, reduce costs, and increase efficiency across your infrastructure.  The agent is designed to run as a container in each cluster inside your orchestration system.

## Kubernetes

By default, the agent runs in a namespace named "cloudability" (see options below).  Once deployed, the agent will pull metrics from the Kubernetes API and directly from each node in the cluster it is running in.  An example kubernetes deployment can be found [here](deploy/kubernetes/cloudability-metrics-agent.yaml).

Every 10 minutes the metrics agent creates a tarball of the gathered metrics and uploads to an Amazon Web Service S3 bucket. This process requires outbound connections to https://metrics-collector.cloudability.com/, to obtain a pre-signed URL, and https://apptio*.s3.amazonaws.com/ to upload the data. If the metrics agent is deployed behind a firewall, these addresses should be added to the outbound allow list.

## Supported Versions

### Kubernetes Versions

Kubernetes version 1.30 is supported by metrics agent on AWS cloud service (EKS).
Kubernetes versions 1.29 and below are supported by the metrics agent on AWS cloud service (EKS), Google Cloud Platform (GKE), Azure cloud services (AKS), and Oracle Cloud (OKE).

### OpenShift Versions

OpenShift versions 4.14 to 4.10 are supported by the metrics agent on ROSA.

#### Architectures

On AWS, both AMD64 and ARM architectures are supported.

### Deploying with Helm

Instructions for deploying the metrics-agent using Helm can be found [here](https://cloudability.github.io/metrics-agent/). For helm versioning this repository follows the [simple 1-1 versioning](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/new-helm/helm-best-practices/#simple-1-1-versioning) strategy where the chart version is in snyc with the actual application.

### Unsupported Configurations

Cloudability Metrics Agent currently does not support Rancher or On Prem clusters.

## Computing Resources for Metrics Agent

The following recommendation is based on number of nodes in the cluster. It's for references only. The actual required resources depends on a number of factors such as number of nodes, pods, workload, etc. Please adjust the resources depending on your actual usage. By default, the helm installation and manifest file configures the first row (nodes < 100) from the reference table.

| Number of Nodes | CPU Request | CPU Limit | Mem Request |  Mem Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| < 100 | 500m | 1000m | 2GBi | 4GBi |
| 100-200 | 1000m | 1500m | 4GBi | 8GBi |
| 200-500 | 1500m | 2000m | 8GBi | 16GBi |
| 500-1000 | 2000m | 3000m | 16GBi | 24GBi |
| 1000+ | 3000m |  | 24GBi |  |

## Networking Requirement for Metrics Agent
The container that hosts the metrics agent should allow HTTPS requests to following endpoints:
- metrics-collector.cloudability.com port 443

The container that hosts the metrics agent should have write access to following Apptio S3 buckets:
- apptio* (bucket prefixed with apptio)

## Development

### Dependency management

We're using [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for Go dependencies.

### Source Code Analysis

We're using [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) for static source code analysis.

## Contributing code

You'll find information and help on how to contribute code in
[the CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repo.


### To Run Locally

You must obtain a valid API Key and export it locally as an environment variable.

```sh
export CLOUDABILITY_API_KEY={your_api_key}
make deploy-local
```

## Local Development

The makefile target _deploy-local_ assumes that you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and kubernetes (with a context: docker-for-desktop) running locally. The target does the following:

- Builds a container with the local project codebase 
- Locally creates a deployment / pod with the local metrics agent container

### Testing
In addition to running all go tests via the make step `make test`,  `make test-e2e-all` runs end to end tests by spinning up a [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) cluster, building the metrics agent, deploying it to the reference clusters, then testing the collected data.  The use of kind requires a local docker daemon to be running.
