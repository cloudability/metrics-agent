# metrics-agent

The metrics-agent collects allocation metrics from a Kubernetes cluster system and sends the metrics to cloudability to help you gain visibility, reduce costs, and increase efficiency across your infrastructure.  The agent is designed to run as a container in each cluster inside your orchestration system.

## Kubernetes

By default, the agent runs in a namespace named "cloudability" (see options below).  Once deployed, the agent will pull metrics from the Kubernetes API and directly from each node in the cluster it is running in. Additionally it will pull metrics from [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster) if found running in the kube-system namespace.  An example kubernetes deployment can be found [here](deploy/kubernetes/cloudability-metrics-agent.yaml).

Every 10 minutes the metrics agent creates a tarball of the gathered metrics and uploads to an Amazon Web Service S3 bucket. This process requires outbound connections to https://metrics-collector.cloudability.com/, to obtain a pre-signed URL, and https://cldy-cake-pipeline.s3.amazonaws.com/ to upload the data. If the metrics agent is deployed behind a firewall, these addresses should be added to the outbound allow list.

### Supported Versions

#### 1.18 

Metrics agent versions >= `1.5.0` support Kubernetes 1.18. It is fully backwards compatible with all previous supported versions as well.
Metrics agent versions < `1.5.0` require some manual tweaks on every node in the cluster in order to run on Kubernetes 1.18. 

##### Background

Kubernetes 1.18 [disabled by default the cadvisor endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/68522) that the original metrics agent used to collect rich utilization data from the cluster. In order to run metrics agent versions < `1.5.0` on 1.18, you need to [manually enable the cadvisor endpoints on the kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) via the `--enable-cadvisor-json-endpoints` flag for every node in the cluster.

#### 1.17 and below

Kubernetes versions 1.17 and below are supported by the metrics agent.

| CLOUDABILITY_NAMESPACE                  | Optional: Override the namespace that the agent runs in. It is not recommended to change this as it may negatively affect the agents ability to collect data. Default: `cloudability`|

| CLOUDABILITY_LOG_LEVEL                  | Optional: Log level to run the agent at (INFO,WARN,DEBUG,TRACE). Default: `INFO`|

## Development

### Dependency management

We're using [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for Go dependencies.

### Source Code Analysis

We're using [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) for static source code analysis.

## Contributing code

You'll find information and help on how to contribute code in
[the CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repo.


### To Run Locally

You must obtain a valid API Key and export it locally as an environment variable.

```sh
export CLOUDABILITY_API_KEY={your_api_key}
make deploy-local
```

## Local Development

The makefile target _deploy-local_ assumes that you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and kubernetes (with a context: docker-for-desktop) running locally. The target does the following:

- Builds a container with the local project codebase 
- Locally creates a deployment / pod with the local metrics agent container

### Testing
In addition to running all go tests via the make step `make test`,  `make test-e2e-all` runs end to end tests by spinning up a [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) cluster, building the metrics agent, deploying it to the reference clusters, then testing the collected data.  The use of kind requires a local docker daemon to be running.
